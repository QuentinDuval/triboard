# triboard

This project is aimed at creating a small game based on the old Tribolo DOS game, whose description can be found here: http://www.mobygames.com/game/tribolo.

The goal is basically to change the board into the blue color, through moves over enemy pieces.

You can play the game here: https://quentinduval.github.io/tribolo/.
